# malrewrite
A list of rewrite rules to counteract known malicious automated requests by bots and rules to improve security of your content management system.

## The idea behind malrewrite...
The entries in this .htaccess are gathered by me and are sorted by content management system.
As these are combined into a .htaccess, it's obviously intended for use on a LAMP-stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). I started collecting recurring POST-request I saw when investigating hacking and hacking attempts and thought it to be a great idea to combine and block those using rewrite rules.
Also, it seemed like a good idea to add other rules to strengthen security.
